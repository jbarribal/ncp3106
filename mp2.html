      <h2>Keep showing up if no one invests in you.
        Invest in yourself if no one believes in
        you. Believe in yourself even if you
        don't see the results right away .</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>Even if you don't see the results for
        very very long time keep showing up. What
        if the results don't come they're not
        going to come if you quit.Just start doing something.
        Take that first step, every step you take
        adds up and sooner or later you'll look
        back and see that you're at the top of
        the staircase it doesn't matter if you
        can't see the top from where you are
        just know that if you keep climbing if
        you keep learning how you can get to the
        next level you will soon be exactly
        where you need to be. If you quit, if you
        never start crying if you never take
        that first step you'll never get there
        and you'll forever live in regret</p>
      <p>Things are really really difficult
        and so what successful entrepreneurs do
        is they just keep doing it
        over and over and over and over and over
        and over and over and eventually,
        if they're fortunate one of their ideas
        happens to hit
        the right place at the right time. Even
        if your idea is good that doesn't mean
        it will be successful
        there's so many things that have to be
        taken into account so
        this is partly why persistence and
        that's part of conscientiousness is so
        useful.
        It's like persistence is helpful because
        it enables you to run many many
        experiments and
        and you need to know that the baseline
        is failure you know it's important
        because otherwise
        you'll blame that on yourself you know
        and
        some of that's useful because there's
        probably some things that you could
        improve about yourself but
        it's very difficult to go from zero to
        one</p>
