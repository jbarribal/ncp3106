  <h3>Keep showing up if no one invests in you.
    Invest in yourself if no one believes in
    you. Believe in yourself even if you
    don't see the results right away .</h3>
  <p style ="font-family:Assistant">Even if you don't see the results for
    very very long time keep showing up. What
    if the results don't come they're not
    going to come if you quit.Just start doing something.
    Take that first step, every step you take
    adds up and sooner or later you'll<br> look
    back and see that you're at the top of
    the staircase it doesn't matter if you
    can't see the top from where you are
    just know that if you keep climbing if
    you keep learning how you can get to the
    next level you will soon be exactly<br>
    where you need to be. If you quit, if you
    never start crying if you never take
    that first step you'll never get there
    and you'll forever live in regret</p>
    <p style ="font-family:Assistant">Things are really really difficult
      and so what successful entrepreneurs do
      is they just keep doing it
      over and over and over and over and over
      and over and over and eventually,<br>
      if they're fortunate one of their ideas
      happens to hit
      the right place at the right time. Even
      if your idea is good that doesn't mean
      it will be successful
      there's so many things that have to be
      taken into account so
      this is partly why persistence and
      that's part of conscientiousness is so
      useful.<br>
      It's like persistence is helpful because
      it enables you to run many many
      experiments and
      and you need to know that the baseline
      is failure you know it's important
      because otherwise
      you'll blame that on yourself you know
      and<br>
      some of that's useful because there's
      probably some things that you could
      improve about yourself but
      it's very difficult to go from zero to
      one</p>
